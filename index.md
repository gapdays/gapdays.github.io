#### What is GAP?

[GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) is a computer algebra system with a focus
on computational group theory.

#### What are GAP Days?

GAP Days are meetings where developers and users with
 programming experience are invited to
influence the future development of GAP by initiating and contributing to
discussions and coding sprints. As enough GAP experts will be around for
technical support, the meetings usually offer good opportunities for
people to work on their own packages. To streamline each meeting the
organizers will usually suggest a few main topics to work on during the
week.

The meetings are also suitable for advertising recent developments in core GAP
and packages via short talks. However, the focus of the meetings is usually on
code development, with talks only playing a minor role.
